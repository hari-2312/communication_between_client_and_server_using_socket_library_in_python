socket library in Python involves creating a server socket to listen for incoming connections and a client socket to initiate a connection to the server.
 the server listens on a specific host and port, accepts a connection when a client connects, and then sends and receives messages. 
 The client connects to the server, receives a welcome message, sends a message to the server, and then closes the connection.
we can run the server and client in command prompt windows and python shell. server can run first and then the client.
